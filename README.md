Project Euler Solutions
=======================

Practicing Java Coding speed using [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) problems. None of these solutions are super readable or necessarily efficient although they all finish in less than one minute as per the Project Euler recommendations. Most of the early problems are quite easy so they are good practice for typing Competition Java Code.

With love Jam.
